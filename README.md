# SOA4-project
Service Oriented Architect 4 Project


Overview of Project:
1.	Create two new Services (not Student/Course or anything we used in class) of your choice. Use JPA for the databases. 
2.	Connect Service A (consumer) to Service B (producer) using Request-Response (Asynchronous Nonblocking) style of communication.
3.	Research how to use ETags in Spring Boot to implement HTTP caching, and implement it in the project. Use caching on the collection only.
4.	Design a HTML/JS client to showcase the communication and caching in action.
